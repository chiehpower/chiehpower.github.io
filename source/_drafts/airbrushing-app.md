I would introduce a series of apps about airbrushing tools which have been uesd for a long time.
In my experience, there are different advantages and their functions between each app, therefore, we need to know what we require and what effect we want to express.
On the other hand, most of applications usually have same functions including adjusting filter, brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, vignette, etc. Personally, I consider that there is not the best app, but there is the most suitable. So choosing one app to familiarity is the most important task for the beginner.
