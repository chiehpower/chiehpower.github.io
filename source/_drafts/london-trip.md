(sorry, I would use my poor english to introduce the day trip of this time.)
Date: 2018/12/28
Because we just came back UK not for a long time, we didn't want to go to very far place. We decided to go to London and visited many places including very famous Harry Potter station, the biggest library, museum, cool old-school red bus, and market.
I will separate those different categories in this artic]le.
