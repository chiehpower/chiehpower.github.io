<font size="5">**Research fields**</font><br />
  - Computational Materials Simulation
  - Physics Program Development
  - Machine Learning / Deep Learning
  - My master's thesis title: [Analysis of Regularization and Multi-layers Architecture of ResNet](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336890516_Analysis_of_Regularization_and_Multi-layers_Architecture_of_ResNet)

<font size="5">**Professional techniques**</font><br />
  - Program languages: Python, PySpark, Git, R, MatLab, Fortran, SQL (& PostgreSQL), Shell-script, Hexo (& HTML)
  - Experience
    - **Python**
      - Function (i.e., def) method, OOP (e.g., Class), Bisection search, Regular/ Generator expression, etc.
      - Tensorflow, Keras (Familiar with building models. For instance, Use the Functional API to build the ResNets architecture models of different layers), Scikitlearn, and other Open-Source libraries.
      - [Web-scraping](https://github.com/chiehpower/Web-Scraping) (Get, Request, Post, Beautiful Soup, Selenium, etc.), For example, [automatically fill in the questionnaire star survey](https://github.com/chiehpower/Web-Scraping/blob/master/Questionnaire.ipynb), [WeChat bot](https://github.com/chiehpower/Bot)
      - Use PySpark (with Hadoop) to process big data. (the methods including Lambda, Reduce, Map, Filter, and so on.)
    - **Matlab**
      - More particular parts is using such as term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf), Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
    - **R**
      - The packages are related to machine learning (ex. gmb, randomForest, kmeans, hclust.)
    - Using Latex, writing pseudo code, using Git and Github, server management and maintenance on Linux.
    - Data analysis for over three years
    - Computing physical properties of materials by CASTEP on the Materials Studio and linux for over three years.
    - Writing automatical script by Shell.

<font size="5">**Hobbies**</font><br />
  - Aqua fans (Experience: aquatic garden, Neocaridina denticulate sinensis, Cambarellus, aquarium fish, etc.)
  - Photography (without portrait photography), such as taking pictures which focus on nature landscape photography and adjusting. Furthermore, the highest challenge is using app to retouch photos.
  - Motorcycle and Scooter.
  - Music.
